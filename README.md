We wanted to study the link between the economic and social situation of women and the level of development of the country.

To measure this link, we have constructed a multidimensional indicator that assesses the impact of the condition of women on development.

Our work is in this [Notebook](https://github.com/cmllbll/projet-python-2A/blob/main/Condition%20des%20femmes%20et%20d%C3%A9veloppement%20%C3%A9conomique.ipynb).
